# Rotating Circle Animation

## Overview

This project is a simple, responsive web application that demonstrates a rotating circle animation. The circle rotates 180 degrees when you click on the left or right arrow buttons, while the icons (a home and an envelope) inside remain upright. The application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and leverages CSS variables for maintainable color theming.

## Features

- **Smooth Animation:** The circle rotates with a fluid animation effect.
- **Static Icons:** Icons inside the circle stay vertical as the circle rotates.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Maintainable Styling:** Uses CSS variables for colors, making future design tweaks easy.
- **Semantic Markup:** Employs semantic HTML elements for improved accessibility and readability.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for markup.
- **CSS3** for styling, animations, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript** for interactive behavior.
- **Font Awesome** for iconography.
